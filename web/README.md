This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Using Docker
You can use the docker-compose.yml file from the root project directory using the command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

or follow the process here:

### Manual Installation
First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Development Guide

[As of Mar 30]

### Authentication
There is a hard coded configuration for authentication to work locally. This can be altered for proper auth setup. The configuration is in `app/page.tsx`. The configuration is as follows:

```typescript
const isAuthenticated = true;
```

Toggling this boolean value will render the app with authentication enabled/disabled.

### APIs

The API endpoints are defined in `app/api.ts`. These endpoints use mock data for development purposes. These will need to integrate with a real backend in production.
